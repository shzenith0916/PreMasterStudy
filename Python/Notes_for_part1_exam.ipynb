    "### What is a program?\n",
    "* Sequence of instructions\n",
    "* Specifies how to perform a 'computation'\n",
    "* Typical components:\n",
    "    * Input\n",
    "    * Output\n",
    "    * Calculation\n",
    "    * Conditional execution *(check for certain conditions and run the appropriate code)*\n",
    "    * Repetition *(Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation)*\n",
    "* Breaking a large, complex task into smaller subtasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic operators\n",
    "* `+` for addition/concatenation\n",
    "* `-` for subtraction\n",
    "* `*` for multiplication\n",
    "* `/` for division\n",
    "* `**` for exponentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "### String operators\n",
    "* `+` for string concatenation (`\"one\" + \" \" + \"two\"`; Returns `\"one two\"`)\n",
    "* `*` for string repetition (`\"Hi\" * 3`; Returns `\"HiHiHi\"`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Values and types\n",
    "* A *value* is a basic input the program works with; ie. letter or number\n",
    "* Values can be of different *types*:\n",
    "    * `int` for integers (2)\n",
    "    * `float` for floating-point numbers (2.0)\n",
    "    * `str` for strings (`'Hello, World!`)\n",
    "        * Strings are **immutable**. You can create a new string from an existing string, but you cannot change an existing string.\n",
    "* When requesting the type for a value (ie. `type(2)`), Python returns `<class 'int'>`. *Class* is used in the sense of a category; a type is a category of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Natural languages vs. Formal languages\n",
    "* A programming language is a formal language\n",
    "    * Strict **syntax** rules\n",
    "    * **Parsing:** figuring out the structure; also done by an interpreter or compiler\n",
    "    * Little to no ambiguity\n",
    "    * Typically more concise than natual language\n",
    "    * Punctuation is important in Python\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Variables, expressions, and statements\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "* **Variable:** a named 'location' to store a value(s)\n",
    "* Variables also relate to the concept of 'state'\n",
    "* Choose *meaningful* variable names\n",
    "* Python **keywords** cannot be used as a variable name\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expressions\n",
    "* Any combination of zero or more values and/or zero or more variables and/or operators and/or function calls\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statements\n",
    "* A unit of code that has an effect.\n",
    "* *Assignment statement*: creates a new variable and gives it a value (ie. `n = 17`)\n",
    "* *Print statement*: displays a result (`print(n)`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Errors\n",
    "* *Syntax error*: with regards to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure (ie. `(1+2)` is legal but `8)` is a syntax error since parentheses have to come in matching pairs)\n",
    "* *Runtime error/Exceptions*: this error does not appear until after the program has started running; indicates something exceptional (and bad) has happened\n",
    "* *Semantic error*: with regards to the meaning; semantic errors in your program will run without generating an error message, but it will not output the intended result. "

    "* Scope: the places where a *variable* may be referenced (used)\n",

    " (1) Relatively compact code, (nearly) no negative impact on performance/speed\n",
    "<br> (2) User-friendly error messages </br>\n",
    "<br> (3) Code can continue (does not necessarily end the program) </br>\n",

    "#### A) Exception Handling\n",

    "* **Set literal**: denoted like a dictionary, but no KV-pairs - an element is one (complex) value\n",
    "    * Example: `mixed_set = {34, 'Ice cream', (56,89)}`\n",
    "        * Why is the expression in `mixed_set` literal? *Because the values cannot change.*\n",
    "* Values must be *hashable*, in practice this means **immutable**.\n",
    "* Sets are **unordered**.\n",
    "* A value can only be in a set once - *values are unique*.\n",
    "* Familiar operations, like:\n",
    "    * `element in my_set` will return a Boolean data type\n",
    "    * `len(my_set)` will return number of elements in a set\n",
    "* Specific operations:\n",
    "    * **`set1.union(set2)`** joins unique values\n",
    "    * **`set1.intersection(set2)`** returns intersecting values\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set Operators\n",
    "* *Sample sets:* \n",
    "    * ` set1 = {'Cat','Dog','Fish'}\n",
    "    set2 = {'Bird','Cow','Dog'`\n",
    "* **`set1 - set2`** or **`difference()`** \n",

    "    * `set1.difference(set2)` returns `{'Cat','Fish'}`\n",
    "* **`set1 & set 2`** or **`intersection()`** \n",
    "    * Returns a new set with elements common to the set and all others.\n",
    "    * `set1.intersection(set2)` returns `{'Dog'}`\n",
    "* **`set1 | set2`** or **`union()`** \n",
    "    * Returns a new set with elements from the set and all others\n",
    "    * `set1.union(set2)` returns `{'Cat','Dog','Fish','Bird','Cow'}`\n",
    "* **`set1 ^ set2`** or **`symmetric_difference()`** \n",
    "    * Returns a new set with elements in either the set or other but not both.\n",
    "    * `set1.symmetric_difference(set2)` returns `{'Cow','Fish','Cat','Bird'}`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Converting to a set\n",
    "* Use a **set comprehension** - `{element for element in listofelements}`\n",
    "* Use **`set()`** - `set(listofelements)`\n",
